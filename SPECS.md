SortingCards
============

In this project, you will write a program to simulate a deck of cards. We will add functionality to guess what the card on the top of the deck is, and sort the deck.

In order to build good habits, we've broken the project into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility.

Iteration 1: Cards and Guesses
==============================

We start off with a Card object. A Card is initialized with a value and suit. The Card class should respond to the following interaction pattern:

```
card = Card.new("Ace", "Spades")
card.value
=> "Ace"
card.suit
=> "Spades"

```

Along with the Card, we also have a Guess. It should respond to the following interaction pattern:

```
card = Card.new("10", "Hearts")
guess = Guess.new("10 of Hearts", card)
guess.card
=> #<Card:0x007ffdf1820a90 @value="10", @suit="Hearts">
guess.response
=> "10 of Hearts"
guess.correct?
=> true
guess.feedback
=> "Correct!"

```

We also want to make sure that incorrect guesses are handled properly.

```
card = Card.new("Queen", "Clubs")
guess = Guess.new("2 of Diamonds", card)
guess.card
=> #<Card:0x007ffdf1820a90 @value = "Queen", @suit="Clubs">
guess.response
=> "2 of Diamonds"
guess.correct?
=> false
guess.feedback
=> "Incorrect."

```

Iteration 2: Storing Cards in a Deck and The Round
==================================================

Let's store the cards in a Deck.

```
card_1 = Card.new("3","Hearts")
card_2 = Card.new("4", "Clubs")
card_3 = Card.new("5", "Diamonds")
deck = Deck.new([card_1, card_2, card_3])
deck.cards
=> [card_1, card_2, card_3]
deck.count
=> 3

```

A Round will be the object that processes responses and records guesses. The idea is that when we start a Round, the current card is the first in the deck. As we make a guess on that card, the current card becomes the next card in the deck.

```
card_1 = Card.new("3","Hearts")
card_2 = Card.new("4", "Clubs")
deck = Deck.new([card_1, card_2])
round = Round.new(deck)
round.deck
=> #<Deck:0x007ffdf181b9c8 @cards=[...]>
round.guesses
=> []
round.current_card
=> #<Card:0x007ffdf1820a90 @value="3", @suit="Hearts">
round.record_guess({value: "3", suit: "Hearts"})
=> #<Guess:0x007ffdf19c8a00 @card=#<Card:0x007ffdf1820a90 @value="3", @suit="Hearts">, @response="3 of Hearts">
round.guesses.count
=> 1
round.guesses.first.feedback
=> "Correct!"
round.number_correct
=> 1
round.current_card
=> #<Card:0x007ffdf1820a90 @value="4", @suit="Clubs">
round.record_guess({value: "Jack", suit: "Diamonds"})
=> #<Guess:0x007ffdf19c8a00 @card=#<Card:0x007ffdf1820a90 @value="4", @suit="Clubs">, @response="Jack of Diamonds">
round.guesses.count
=> 2
round.guesses.last.feedback
=> "Incorrect."
round.number_correct
=> 1
round.percent_correct
=> 50

```

Iteration 3: Sorting the Deck
=============================

In this iteration, we will start to add some algorithmic complexity. We are going to add to the deck object the ability to sort the cards based on their value from lowest to highest. The order of values from lowest to highest is 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.

If two cards have the same value, the suit should be used to determine the order they are sorted. The order of suit from lowest to highest is Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades.

You are *NOT* allowed to use any built in sorting methods.

The interaction pattern will look like this:

```
card_1 = Card.new("4","Hearts")
card_2 = Card.new("Jack", "Clubs")
card_3 = Card.new("5", "Diamonds")
card_4 = Card.new("Ace", "Spades")
card_5 = Card.new("Ace", "Diamonds")
deck = Deck.new([card_1, card_2, card_3, card_4, card_5])

deck.sort
=> [card_1, card_3, card_2, card_5, card_4]

```

Iteration 4: Merge Sort
=======================

We're doing the same here, but with a different sorting algorithm, merge sort. As you implement this, think about why do we need different algorithms? How many swaps does your sort from iteration 3 make in the best case scenario? Worst case? How does this compare to Merge Sort?

The interaction pattern will look like this:

```
card_1 = Card.new("4","Hearts")
card_2 = Card.new("Jack", "Clubs")
card_3 = Card.new("5", "Diamonds")
card_4 = Card.new("Ace", "Spades")
card_5 = Card.new("Ace", "Diamonds")
deck = Deck.new([card_1, card_2, card_3, card_4, card_5])

deck.merge_sort
=> [card_1, card_3, card_2, card_5, card_4]

```

Evaluation Rubric
=================

Functionality
-------------

-   Student completes through Iteration 3

Mechanics
---------

The student:

-   appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
-   implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
-   uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
-   uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
-   creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

Design
------

The student:

-   adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
-   creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
-   uses instance and local variables appropriately
-   writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    -   Variable and method names are self explanatory
    -   Methods are under 7 lines
    -   Lines of code are under 80 characters

Testing
-------

The student:

-   writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
-   names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
